High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most

The ones who'd been gone for so very long
She couldn't remember their names
They spun her around on the damp old stones
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

They danced through the day
And into the night through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer then winter again
Til the walls did crumble and fall

And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones
Who had loved her the most

You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

You keep me up at night
To my messages, you do not reply
You know I still like you the most
The best of the best and the worst of the worst
Well, you can never know
The places that I go
I still like you the most
You'll always be my favorite ghost

You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

Sometimes I think it's gettin' better
And then it gets much worse
Is it just part of the process?
Well, Jesus Christ, it hurts
Though I know I should know better
Well, I can make this work
Is it just part of the process?
Well, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts

You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

Shower your affection, let it rain on me
And pull down the mountain, drag your cities to the sea
Shower your affection, let it rain on me
Don't leave me on this white cliff
Let it slide down to the, slide down to the sea
Slide down to the, slide down to the sea


Looking up from underneath
Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under

And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under all

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
And now I am under all

And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

And it's over
And I'm going under
But I'm not giving up
I'm just giving in

I'm slipping underneath
So cold and so sweet

And the arms of the ocean so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion I never knew at all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
And the arms of the ocean delivered me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Deliver me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Deliver me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Deliver me
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

And it's over
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
And I'm going under
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
But I'm not giving up
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
I'm just giving in
(Never let me go, Never let me go)

I'm slipping underneath
(Never let me go, Never let me go)
So cold and so sweet
(Never let me go, Never let me go)

The show was ending and I had started to crack
Woke up in Chicago and the sky turned black
And you're so high, you're so high, you had to be an angel
And I'm so high, I'm so high, I can see an angel

I hear your heart beating in your chest
The world slows 'till there's nothing left
Skyscrapers look on like great, unblinking giants (oh)

In those heavy days in June
When love became an act of defiance

Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other

You were broken-hearted and the world was, too
And I was beginning to lose my grip
And I always held it loosely
But this time I admit
I felt it really start to slip

And choir singing in the street
And I will come to you
To watch the television screen
In your hotel room

Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other

You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You had to be an angel
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I can see an angel

No walls
Can keep me protected
No sleep
Nothing inbetween me and the rain
And you can't save me now,
I'm in the grip of a hurricane
I'm gonna blow myself away

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else,
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse

No home,
I don't want shelter
No calm,
Nothing to keep me from the storm
And you can't hold me down
'Cause I belong to the hurricane
It's gonna blow this all away

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse

I hope that you see me
Cause I'm staring at you
But when you look over
You look right through
Then you lean and kiss her on the head
And I never felt so alive, and so... dead.

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out, woah-oh-o

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out, woah-oh-o
I'm going out, woah-oh-o
I'm going o-o-o-o-o-o-out
I'm going out, woah-oh-o
I'm going out

This is as good a place to fall as any
We'll build our altar here
Make me your Maria
I'm already on my knees

You had Jesus on your breath
And I caught him in mine
Sweating our confessions
The undone and the divine

'Cause this is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers
And I can't get enough

Oh, woah, woah, oh
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah

Spilled milk tears,
I did this for you
Spilling over the idol
The black and the blue

The sweetest submission
Drinking it in
The wine, the women, the bedroom hymns

'Cause this is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers and I can't get enough

Oh, woah, woah, oh
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough

I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I found myself an old solution
I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I found myself an old solution

This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers, I can't get enough

This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers, I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah

Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Cause I’ve loved and I’ve lost

I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the parties over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Cause I’ve loved and I’ve lost

It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know

Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Cause I’ve loved and I’ve lost

I've loved and I've lost [3x]

And the air was full
Of various storms and saints
Praying in the street
As the banks began to break
And I'm in the throes of it
Somewhere in the belly of the beast
But you took your toll on me
So I gave myself over willingly
You got a hold on me
And I don't know how I don't just stand outside and scream
I am teaching myself how to be free

The monument of a memory
You tear it down in your head
Don't make the mountain your enemy
Get out, get up there instead
You saw the stars out in front of you
Too tempting not to touch
But even though it shocked you
Something's electric in your blood

And people just untie themselves
Uncurling lifelines
If you could just forgive yourself

But still you stumble, feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
You sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart, don't give it away

You'll find a rooftop to sing from
Or find a hallway to dance
You don't need no edge to cling from
Your heart is there, it's in your hands
I know it seems like forever
I know it seems like an age
But one day this will be over
I swear it's not so far away

And people just untie themselves
Uncurling lifelines
If you could just forgive yourself

But still you stumble, feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
You sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart

m drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)

[Refrain:]
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)

Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
(Holding on for your call)
Another drink just to pass the time
(I can never say no)

[Refrain]

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around

[Chorus:]
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you, I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)

Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
(Holding on for your call)
Taking the pills just to pass the time
(I can never say no)

[Refrain]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know?
[x2]

[Pre-Chorus x2]

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around
[x2]

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So, darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

And, darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me

Darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

There is love in your body but you can't hold it in
It pours from your eyes and spills from your skin
Tenderest touch leaves the darkest of marks
And the kindest of kisses break the hardest of hearts

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

There is love in your body but you can't get it out
It gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
Sticks to your tongue and shows on your face
That the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But you'll never know what a fool I've been
Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But that's no excuse for the state I'm in

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

There is love in our bodies and it holds us together
But pulls us apart when we're holding each other
We all want something to hold in the night
We don't care if it hurts or we're holding too tight

There is love in your body but you can't get it out
It gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
Sticks to your tongue and it shows on your face
That the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But you'll never know what a fool I've been
Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But that's no excuse for the state I'm in

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

My heart swells like a water at weight
Can't stop myself before it's too late
Hold on to your heart
'Cause I'm coming to take you
Hold on to your heart
'Cause I'm coming to break you

Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
The hardest of hearts (hold on, hold on)
The hardest of hearts (hold on, hold on)
The hardest of hearts (hold on)


Time it took us
To where the water was
That’s what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
Oh, my love, don’t forsake me
Take what the water gave me

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

And oh, poor Atlas
The world’s a beast of a burden
You’ve been holding up a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
That’s what the water gave us

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

‘Cause they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You couldn't have it any other way

‘Cause she’s a cruel mistress
And a bargain must be made
But oh, my love, don’t forget me
When I let the water take me

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the over flow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

Everybody wants to be famous,
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless,
People act shameless
Tryna live like entertainers,
Want a fat crib with the acres,
So they spend money that they ain't made yet,
Got a Benz on tick that they ain't paid yet,
Spend their paycheck
In the west out on a weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend.
But they don't care cause their life is a movie,
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly,
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks,
Can't keep up with the cover notes,
So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit in debt
They still don't get it
Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life
Huggin' the high when livin' it large
And they all say

[Florence]
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
(That's right)
Now and then it seems like life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

[Dizzee Rascal]
Let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty
Everybody's on a paper chase
It's one big rat race
Everybody's got a screw face
So many two-faced,
Checkin' their high sayin' they're ready to ride
I'm on the inside looking at the
So it's an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the southside
Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs cause the city's like a sauna
And it's getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
Mr. Politician can you tell me the solution
What's the answer, what's the conclusion
Is it an illusion, is it a mirage
I see youngsters die because they tryna live large
And they all say

[Florence]
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on all of you
Sometimes I feel like saying “Lord, I just don't care”
(That's right, that's right)
But you've got the love I need to see me through
(Check it, check it, come on, come on)

You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(Check it)

[Dizzee Rascal]
We are living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough
I'm tryna have a bunch
But I can't have rice for lunch
It's not there ain't enough to share
It ain't fair never dreamed that he could be rare
Who cares who dares to make a change
Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere's the same
Again and again I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they play sailin'
But I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession I can't front I’m in the forefront
Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope but I ain't trying to see the bottom
Because that's where I came from, I ain't forgotten,

[Florence]
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
You got the love
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
(Who's got the love, who's got the love, who's got the love)

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on all of you
Sometimes I feel like saying “Lord, I just don't care”
But you've got the love I need to see me through

And the heart is hard to translate
It has a language of its own
It talks in tongues and quiet sighs
And prayers and proclamations
In the grand deeds of great men and the smallest of gestures
And short shallow gasps

But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

And it talks to me in tiptoes
And it sings to me inside
It cries out in the darkest night and breaks in the morning light

But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

No, words are a language
It doesn't deserve such treatment
And all of my stumbling phrases never amounted to anything worth this feeling

All this heaven never could describe such a feeling as I'm hearing

Words were never so useful
So I was screaming out a language that I never knew existed before

Are you hurting the one you love?
You say you've found Heaven but you can't find God.
Are you hurting the one you love?
Bite your tongue till it tastes like blood.

Are you hurting the one you love?
So many glasses on the tabletop.
Are you hurting the one you love?
You'd like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough.

Tough,
It's just too tough.
Tough,
It's just too tough.

Are you hurting the one you love?
When they watched the walls, and the ticking clock.
Are you hurting the one you love?
And was it something you could not stop.

Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.

Are you hurting the one you love?
When you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground.
Are you hurting the one you love?
And lost for themselves.

Are you hurting the one you love?
And if heaven knows then who will stop.
Are you hurting the one you love?
You said you got to heaven, but it wasn't enough.

I love you all the time
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, ah

I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time

I'm fueled up and high, I'm out with the guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time

I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I can tell you're going to take your love away

I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

Ce soir c’est le soir
Et toi avec moi
Et tu viens me voir
Tu viens, oh la la
I love you all the time

Tu ne réponds pas
Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Just say au revoir
Again me voilà
I love you all the time

And I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I can tell you're going to take your love away

I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay

Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Ah dites-moi pourquoi

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care."
But you've got the love I need To see me through

Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

When food is gone you are my daily meal
When friends are gone I know my Saviour's love is real
You know it's real

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Time after time I think, "Oh, Lord, what's the use?"
Time after time I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love you lose
But you got the love I need to see me through

[2x]
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care."
But you've got the love I need to see me through
